"""Low-level COM helpers for connecting to SAP GUI.

Thread Safety
-------------
COM objects use the Single-Threaded Apartment (STA) model.  All calls to a
given SAP GUI session **must** happen from the same thread that called
``pythoncom.CoInitialize()``.  Creating COM objects on one thread and using
them on another will raise ``pywintypes.com_error`` or cause silent
corruption.

If you use sapsucker from async code, run all COM calls in a dedicated thread
via ``asyncio.to_thread()`` or a ``concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor``.
Each worker thread must call ``pythoncom.CoInitialize()`` before its first
COM operation and ``pythoncom.CoUninitialize()`` when done.

Example::

    import asyncio, pythoncom
    from sapsucker import SapGui

    def _read_status_bar() -> str:
        pythoncom.CoInitialize()
        try:
            app = SapGui.connect()
            session = app.connections[0].sessions[0]
            return session.find_by_id("wnd[0]/sbar").text
        finally:
            pythoncom.CoUninitialize()

    text = asyncio.run(asyncio.to_thread(_read_status_bar))

For heavy async workloads (e.g. multiple parallel callers), consider a dedicated
COM worker thread with a queue, retry logic for transient COM errors, and
adaptive throttling.  The ``ComThread`` class in ``sapwebgui.mcp`` is a
production-grade reference implementation of this pattern.  If a second async
consumer of sapsucker emerges, extracting the core bridge into
``sapsucker.aio`` would be worth revisiting.
